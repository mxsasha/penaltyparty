                    <li>You send the link to anyone you want to have take the test.</li>
                    <li>Each test taker enters their name and runs through all the questions.</li>
                    <li>
                        Test takers see their result and any wrong answers immediately after completing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using your group owner link, you see the scores of everyone who finished the test.</li>

                    When you make your group, we randomly pick 40 questions out of our total set of ~100.
                    Everyone in one group gets the same questions, but in a different order with a different answer
                    order.

                        No. If you think there are errors in the questions/answers, for now
                        report them on <a href="https://github.com/mxsash/penaltyparty">GitHub</a>.

                        Rules testing is no longer required by WFTDA, so it's up to you.
                        Some leagues require a minimum score to graduate as a rookie,
                        some use it as an input for training, or for people to check
                        their own understanding.
                        Be mindful that some people have trouble with written questions
                        but are great on track, and vice versa.
