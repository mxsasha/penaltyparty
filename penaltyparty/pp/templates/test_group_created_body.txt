Hello,

You just created a test group called "{{ test_group.group_name }}" on Penalty Party,
the roller derby rules test platform.

You should share this URL with anyone that should take the test:
{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'test_group_take' group_token=test_group.token_test_taker %}

And here is where you can see all participant's results - share it only
with people who should see those details:
{{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'test_group_owner' token=test_group.token_owner %}

If you do not know what this is about, you may safely ignore this mail,
or if it bothers you, reply and we'll make sure to never email you again.

Penalty Party
