Penalty Party helps roller derby leagues to run testing for
the WFTDA rules. It runs on https://penaltyparty.com/

## Future ideas

Potential things it could do in the future:

* Allow larger question numbers, where a subset is picked for each group 
 by hand or randomly, but biased to have a mix of difficulty and area.
* Allow better than random selection of questions: bias by rule area,
  and/or difficulty of each question.
* Support questions with more than one correct answer.
* Support questions with images, e.g. for penalty signals or showing a track situation.
* Integrating with trackkarma to invite people.
* Linking from each question to the relevant rule/casebook.
* Support group reviews of results.
* Crowd-sourced question database, with trusted people validating answers.
